When I first started working with Ralph he simply asked me what my goal was. I let him know I wanted to tone but really concentrate on getting a flat stomach and lifting my butt. I also told him of my concerns with a past injury and my issues with asthma. Ralph came up with a mix of basic and creative exercises every session that worked to completely heal my injury, tone my body and improve my breathing. Even though the workouts were amazing and I saw results immediately, I honestly would not adhere to his suggestions when it came to my diet. When I decided to really live healthy, I followed a great meal plan he suggested, trained with him and did extra cardio at least twice a week. Ralph put me in the BEST shape I have ever been in all my life. Because of him and me continuing to take his food and workout suggestions and incorporate them in my daily workout plan, my breathing is still great and I have been able to maintain a toned/firm body. He made sure I was in the best shape possible before my last session with him. I look forward to the day I get engaged. Ralph will be one of the first people I call to get me “wedding dress” ready! Thank you for everything. You truly were a blessing to me.

I found out about Ralph though a friend of mine who he previously trained. She had great success from him! She lost a total of 30lbs, so I thought I would give him a try. Boy O boy! The first day I met Ralph, he was nothing but first class. We went over my goals and he also gave me some goals which challenged me more. We did our assessment and I almost didn’t go back because I was that out of shape. From day 1, he took his time with me. He pushed me hard enough to still fell the burn but not overwork me to where I couldn’t walk like you hear about other trainers. He is very understanding. I was 215 and I’m 5’6, I lost 35lbs, dropped 10% body fat, and my stomach went down 6in!!! I did all this in 3 months. He taught me a lifestyle. I continue to train on my own because I had to transfer jobs out of state. Ralph educated me on how to really workout on my own. I love this man and owe him everything. I refuse to go back. It is too bad I had to move. I think I would have him as a trainer for the rest of my life!
Always,
Timothy
