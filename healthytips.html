<h2>DIET TIP OF THE DAY- GAINING/LOOSING WEIGHT ON A BUDGET!!!!</h2>
<p>
 Peanut butter is high in calories and fat at 188 calories and 16 grams of fat (good fat with omega3,6 fatty acids) per two tablespoon serving. It is also a good source of protein at 8 grams per two tablespoon serving. It is best to use all natural peanut butter that will cost you approx $4-$5. Throw it on some whole grain wheat bread which is high in complex carbs so you have long lasting energy for your day for approx. $2-$3 a loaf. A single large hard-boiled egg contains about 6.5 grams of protein and they only cost approx. $1.75 a dozen. Since eggs are fast-digesting forms of protein, eat them in a post-workout meal as well! I personally eat this for breakfast allmost every morning! For only $8, you have a meal that will last you 2weeks...WOW! For people trying to loose weight, you may want to buy low calorie whole grain bread or just eat 1 slice of bread with peanut butter on it
