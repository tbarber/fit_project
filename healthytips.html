<h1>Diet Facts and Tips</h1>
<h2>DIET TIP OF THE DAY- GAINING/LOOSING WEIGHT ON A BUDGET!!!!</h2>
<p>
 Peanut butter is high in calories and fat at 188 calories and 16 grams of fat (good fat with omega3,6 fatty acids) per two tablespoon serving. It is also a good source of protein at 8 grams per two tablespoon serving. It is best to use all natural peanut butter that will cost you approx $4-$5. Throw it on some whole grain wheat bread which is high in complex carbs so you have long lasting energy for your day for approx. $2-$3 a loaf. A single large hard-boiled egg contains about 6.5 grams of protein and they only cost approx. $1.75 a dozen. Since eggs are fast-digesting forms of protein, eat them in a post-workout meal as well! I personally eat this for breakfast allmost every morning! For only $8, you have a meal that will last you 2weeks...WOW! For people trying to loose weight, you may want to buy low calorie whole grain bread or just eat 1 slice of bread with peanut butter on it
</p>
<h1>Oatmeal for Breakfast</h1>
<p>
 Add oatmeal to your breakfast smootie/shake or add fruit to your bowl of oatmeal. Oatmeal is a complex carbohydrate that will give you long lasting energy for your day and plus its good for the heart!

<h1>Summer Time Snack!</h1>

Cut up fresh fruit into bite size pieces. Put them into a freezer safe container into your freezer. Take them out when they are frozen and enjoy! Suck on them like hard candy. This will prevent you from eating over your portion and there good to eat in the summer time

</p>
<h1>Salads</h1>
<p>
All salads aren't good salads. Too much cheese, croutons, and dressing can kill a healthy salad. Try eating no croutons, a sprinkle of cheese, and 2tsp of vinaigrette dressing!

<h1>Drink Water</h1>

The added volume will fill up your stomach, causing you to eat less, and consume fewer calories. If you want to lose weight faster then you need to drink water.</p>
<h1>GET TESTED</h1>
<p>Many people suggest things to take to lose weight or get healthier. One big example is taking a multi vitamin every day. The Only way you know if you even need these things is if you go get a medical physical with a blood test. It will show what is missing out your diet so you’re not adding things in your body you don't need.</p>
<h1>Fat-free is not a license to overeat! </h1>
<p>For the past 30 years, we have been told to cut the fat to lose weight. People filled their shopping carts with lowfat or fat-free foods and ate to their stomachs' content. But as many gained weight instead of losing it, people began to wonder what went wrong. Firstly, lowfat products are made by replacing the fat with sugar, making them low in fat, but high in calories. Secondly, many lowfat foods are filled with refined carbohydrates, which cause the body to oversecrete insulin and promote the storage of fat. Your best bet is to choose foods that are naturally low in fat and calories, such as fruits and vegetables, and to include a balance of complex carbohydrates, lean proteins and healthy fats at each meal.</p>
<h1>PIZZA!!!!!!!!</h1>
<p>Here's a little secret for you: For those occasions when a slice is a must, make your slice a little healthier. Here's quick way to do just that, and still enjoy:

Grab some paper napkins and soak up the oil that's seeping down the front of the slice. You'll save yourself from those extra calories and fat! Also, eat thin crust pizza. It does not have as many carbohydrates. Don’t forget to add lots of vegetables!
