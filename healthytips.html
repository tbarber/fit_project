<h1>Diet Facts and Tips</h1>
<h2>DIET TIP OF THE DAY- GAINING/LOOSING WEIGHT ON A BUDGET!!!!</h2>
<p>
 Peanut butter is high in calories and fat at 188 calories and 16 grams of fat (good fat with omega3,6 fatty acids) per two tablespoon serving. It is also a good source of protein at 8 grams per two tablespoon serving. It is best to use all natural peanut butter that will cost you approx $4-$5. Throw it on some whole grain wheat bread which is high in complex carbs so you have long lasting energy for your day for approx. $2-$3 a loaf. A single large hard-boiled egg contains about 6.5 grams of protein and they only cost approx. $1.75 a dozen. Since eggs are fast-digesting forms of protein, eat them in a post-workout meal as well! I personally eat this for breakfast allmost every morning! For only $8, you have a meal that will last you 2weeks...WOW! For people trying to loose weight, you may want to buy low calorie whole grain bread or just eat 1 slice of bread with peanut butter on it
</p>
<h1>Oatmeal for Breakfast</h1>
<p>
 Add oatmeal to your breakfast smootie/shake or add fruit to your bowl of oatmeal. Oatmeal is a complex carbohydrate that will give you long lasting energy for your day and plus its good for the heart!
 

</p>
<h1>Summer Time Snack!</h1>
<p>
Cut up fresh fruit into bite size pieces. Put them into a freezer safe container into your freezer. Take them out when they are frozen and enjoy! Suck on them like hard candy. This will prevent you from eating over your portion and there good to eat in the summer time

</p>
<h1>Salads</h1>
<p>
All salads aren't good salads. Too much cheese, croutons, and dressing can kill a healthy salad. Try eating no croutons, a sprinkle of cheese, and 2tsp of vinaigrette dressing!
</p>
<h1>Grocery Shopping Tip
If you don't buy it, you can't eat it!
</h1>
<h1>Cooking Tip</h1>
<p>You don’t have to have a carb; rice, noodles, bread, potatoes with you meal. Stir fry by itself is a wonderful meal to help you lose weight or cut your body up. What you see here is shrimp stir fry. Make for a great dinner meal. It consist of shrimp, red/yellow peppers, broccoli, stir fried in extra virgin olive oil, seasoned with Miss’s Dash. You can switch up the lean meats and vegetable combinations so you don’t get sick of the same meal</p>
